Hello! Welcome to the first release of Cryo Climbers. Unfortunetly, there are some bugs. Here are most of the bugs listed from biggest priority to lowest.
- Camera Mod controls are wonky (no more camera mod)
- Trigger pages does not work (disabled)
- You can punch yourself with Punch Mod (might keep that lol)

When there are more bugs, there will be more here! Thank you for playing!
